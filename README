My first attempt at a treetop grammar. Not a real project just yet, but it gives you the grammar and a starting point for getting the code up and running.

Offered with no license, but that Packages.test.gz probably has one. So we'll go with whatever Debian is using for that.

Usage instructions:

bundle install gems
bundle exec ./parser.rb

That should start the slow trudge through the file and allow you to see if it is working properly.
